## Project overview

* Through collaborative co-design, the project with WorkInCulture (WIC) aimed to understand the barriers to inclusion and accessibility when seeking jobs in the arts and culture sector in Canada.
* Using the ideas and outcomes from the co-design process, create a design framework that will help inform and guide decisions for improving and redesigning the WIC job board, website and other services.

**Note:** In this project the Co-Design Outcome Summary is called a “Design Brief” as it is intended as a hand-off document between teams.

### Partner

* WIC is a non-profit arts service organization that assists Canadians in finding employment in the arts and culture sector through skills and career development and job matching. WIC also serves the industry by identifying and raising awareness on employment trends and conditions to help both employers and job seekers in the market.

### Background
* The project conducted online and in-person co-design workshops with over 20 participants.
* Each workshop had 2 sessions:
  * Session 1 focused on identifying desires, needs, and issues facing arts and culture job seekers and sorting them into themes.
  * Session 2 had participants individually and collaboratively create ideas to improve job seeking in practical ways for topics raised in Session 1.

### Desired Outcome

* Gain a better understanding of the barriers, issues, and opportunities for inclusion for diverse employment seekers.
* Articulate of ideas and concepts to guide a redesign of the WIC job board.
* Create a design framework, including artifacts and concepts from co-design, to handoff to web development.

## Creating the Co-Design Outcome Summary

### Approach: Writing for the reader

When writing the co-design outcome summary, the reader may not be familiar with inclusive design or co-design practices. Therefore, the report for WIC included additional information about the principles of inclusive design and the motivation and reasoning behind the co-design approaches taken for the project. This allows the report to have broader reach and longevity beyond its initial purpose.

### Approach: Addressing short-term goals
A short-term goal for the project was to generate specific, practical ideas for a WIC job board redesign and development. To help WIC toward this goal, the outcome summary included the following:
* Conceptualization of desired job seeker and job poster experiences.
* Design mockups that begin to meet the needs of both job seekers and job posters.
* Recommendations for a flexible system architecture that allows future enhancements and yet to be discovered functionality.

This information facilitated transitioning from design conceptualization to early development.

### Approach: Broader impact and future opportunities
The report also aimed to be more broadly useful beyond the scope of the project by drawing upon possible areas to explore that were surfaced through collaborators. For example::
* Opportunities for professional services and training.
* Features and functionality that give job seekers more control over the job seeking process.
* Possible features that begin to address long standing systemic inequalities.
* Adopting inclusive design practices as part of the business process.

## Challenges and Learnings

### Elevate co-designers and their contributions
While the contents of the final published co-design outcome summary is a direct result of co-design workshops, the report itself can improve by making more direct references to individual contributions from collaborators. For example, if a specific feature of a mockups is inspired or a result of a co-design outcome, then specific reference should be made to the individuals or groups who contributed those ideas.

### Explore co-authorship of reports with co-design collaborators
The summaries and reports created for this project were assembled and authored by the design researchers funded by the project. Though the contents of these reports are a result of co-designer’s contributions, their perspectives and expertise should carry throughout the project process.

Involving co-designers as co-authors can help:
* Address possible bias and help balance perspectives
* Elevate issues or ideas relevant to the community
* Ensure co-designer voices and contributions are properly recognized and attributed.

Report co-authorship can be explored more in future projects.

## Impact
The Co-Design Outcome Summary has helped WIC with decisions related to redesigning the online Job Board. In particular:
* Advocating for features and functionality that co-designers created or desired.
* Prioritization of features, functionality, and needs for project planning purposes.
* Awareness to include others from the community in decision making.
* Broadened sensitivity to the various needs of stakeholders: job seekers, job posters, and administrators.
* Future opportunities for services that address identified needs.
